# Pull Request Discovery Behavior for Multibranch Pipeline Jobs

## Overview

As of version 4.0.0 of this plugin, we have added a new pull request discovery behavior for Multibranch Pipeline jobs. This behavior allows the job to discover open pull requests in Bitbucket Server and schedule builds for each individual pull request.

## Configuration

To enable this new feature, simply follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to your Jenkins instance and open the configuration page for your Multibranch Pipeline job.
2. Go to the "Branch Sources -> Bitbucket Server" section.
3. Under "Behaviors", click "Add" and then select "Discover pull requests". This will enable the job to discover open pull requests in your Bitbucket Server.
